  biography: |
    Hi! I'm <strong>Victoria</strong>, a <em>Computer Engineering</em> student at Toronto Metropolitan University dedicated to bridging the gap between <em>high-level AI software</em> and <em>low-level mechatronic hardware</em>. 
    Currently, I am a <strong>Physical AI Lab Intern at SAP</strong>, where I architect autonomous industrial prototypes using <em>NVIDIA SoC</em> and <em>Edge Computing</em>.
    <br/><br/>
    As the <strong>Founder and Captain of FRC Team 9262</strong>, I led a team of 100+ students and raised over <strong>$60,000</strong> to build a 120lb competition robot that ranked 10th in the country. 
    I am passionate about <strong>Sense-Think-Act</strong> loops, robotics, and the future of human-robot interaction. Let's connect!
